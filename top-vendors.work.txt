## Top Vendors Feature - Work Summary

### What was implemented
A new "Top Vendors" page at /top-vendors that displays a ranked list of vendors
(grouped by expense description, case-insensitive) sorted by total spending. Each row shows:
- Rank number (in a circular badge)
- Vendor name (from the first occurrence of the description)
- Expense count
- Most common category (shown as a colored Badge)
- Total amount (formatted as currency)

The page includes:
- Loading skeleton (5 animated placeholder rows) while data loads from localStorage
- Empty state with building icon and call-to-action to add first expense
- Header with "Back to Dashboard" button
- Vendor count display in the card header
- Case-insensitive grouping via .toLowerCase().trim() normalization

### Files created/modified
1. **Created:** src/app/top-vendors/page.tsx - Main page component with aggregateVendors() logic
2. **Modified:** src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx - Added "Top Vendors" nav item with building icon
3. **Modified:** src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx - Added "Vendors" nav item (short label for mobile)

### Dependencies added
None - uses only existing project dependencies.

### Testing approach
- npm run build: PASSED (compiled successfully, 0 errors)
- npm run lint: PASSED (no ESLint warnings or errors)
- Note: Fixed a TypeScript Map iteration issue (downlevelIteration) by using Array.from()

### Integration notes
- Branch: feature/top-vendors
- Worktree: D:/Education/expense-tracker-top-vendors
- Commit: f80acbb - "Add top vendors page with nav links"
- No conflicts expected with main branch (only adds new files + appends to nav arrays)
- When merging with top-categories feature, Sidebar.tsx and MobileNav.tsx will need
  conflict resolution since both features append to the same navItems arrays
