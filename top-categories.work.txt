## Top Categories Feature - Work Summary

### What was implemented
A new "Top Categories" page at /top-categories that displays a ranked list of expense
categories sorted by total spending (highest first). Each row shows:
- Rank number
- Category badge (with color coding)
- Expense count
- Progress bar (colored by category, width proportional to percentage)
- Total amount (formatted as currency)
- Percentage of total spending

The page includes:
- Loading state (animated pulse) while data loads from localStorage
- Empty state with icon and call-to-action to add first expense
- Header with "Back to Dashboard" button
- Grand total display in the card header

### Files created/modified
1. **Created:** src/app/top-categories/page.tsx - Main page component
2. **Modified:** src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx - Added "Top Categories" nav item with bar-chart icon
3. **Modified:** src/components/layout/MobileNav.tsx - Added "Categories" nav item (short label for mobile)

### Dependencies added
None - uses only existing project dependencies.

### Testing approach
- npm run build: PASSED (compiled successfully, 0 errors)
- npm run lint: PASSED (no ESLint warnings or errors)

### Integration notes
- Branch: feature/top-categories
- Worktree: D:/Education/expense-tracker-top-categories
- Commit: 8ff0dcf - "Add top expense categories page with nav links"
- No conflicts expected with main branch (only adds new files + appends to nav arrays)
- When merging with top-vendors feature, Sidebar.tsx and MobileNav.tsx will need
  conflict resolution since both features append to the same navItems arrays
