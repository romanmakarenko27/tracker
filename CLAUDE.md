# Project Guidelines

## Multi-Version Feature Evaluation

When implementing or comparing multiple versions/approaches of a feature, follow the evaluation framework in `my-evaluation-template.md`. Create a scored comparison using its weighted criteria (code quality, functionality, UX, error handling, security, performance, maintainability, production readiness) before recommending a version. Also produce a detailed `code-analysis.md` with per-version technical deep dives as supporting evidence.
